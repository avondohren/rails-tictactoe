== Tic-Tac-Toe
=== Rails and JavaScript addition

This project was created to test our skill with JavaScript. I created this as part of the curriculum for 
Omaha Code School.

It uses JavaScript to play human vs computer games of Tic-Tac-Toe and keep track of past games.

At any point, a game can be saved and resumed later. Past games can be 'recalled' to see the last status of the game.
